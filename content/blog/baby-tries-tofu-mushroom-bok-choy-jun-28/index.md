**The flight between Auckland and Kuala Lumpur with an eight month old could be pleasantly uneventful at best, and unimaginably terrible at worst.** The actuality doesn't quite fit in this duality, as my back would argue it was painful and yet there were delightful, eventful moments as well.  

Delight #1: Baby cut her first tooth somewhere over the Outback in Australia. Husband and I had a friendly $100 wager of when Baby would cut her tooth: He had first two weeks of July. I had last two weeks of July. We were both wrong.

Delight #2: Baby slept most of the trip, in our arms (no bassinet this time, dammit)... until it was meal time.

Delight #3: Baby trying three new foods during the in-flight breakfast! I had the vegetarian breakfast on my table, Baby on my lap. The entree was some sort of Asian noodles with tofu, mushroom, and bok choy. I gave baby a small piece of tofu, a perfect baby food, soft and bland. She chewed it, then grabbed her own bigger piece of tofu.

**There is no better delight than giving a baby a small piece of food, then baby reaching for a bigger piece.** Baby did this at Waffle House with a waffle, she did it again with tofu. It makes my heart feel light.

I gave Baby a mushroom. She did not reach for a bigger piece of mushroom. I'm not surprised; some people have a weird texture thing with mushrooms.

Then Baby played handsy with some bok choy. Bok choy has a weird texture too, right? It's just ... *limp*. But the leafy part soaks up sauce so well, right? Baby didn't know what to make of bok choy: She might have mouthed it, she might have thought it was a dog toy. Later that day, I tore up the leafy part of bok choy and she seemed to put some in her mouth. Or on the floor.

I don't have much love lost if she's meh on bok choy, or mushrooms for that matter.

I love the fact that she went for tofu though! Tofu: such a bland, boring protein. Great in mapo tofu, kinda lame on its own. But for a youngster to grab her own piece of tofu so early in this trip... it makes me smile just because I find it so... unexpected. And because it's unexpected, that is what makes it delightful.
