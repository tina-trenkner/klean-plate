Welcome to this new blog, KLean Plate Club. This blog is a visual diary of our upcoming month in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Travelers, foodies, expats and anyone with a little munchkin in their lives should find something of interest on this blog.

This blog will feature the culinary habits of two grownup foodies and a little human who is starting to try more and more grownup foods. In this main pic, the baby is trying some char siu on rice from the local Auckland food hall.

I hope to document the most delicious things any one of us may be eating, be it a little pair of hands trying dragon fruit or a big pair of hands tucking into some nasi goreng.

I look forward to sharing more food and posts with you very soon! -Tina
