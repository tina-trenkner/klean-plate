Welcome to this new blog, KLean Plate Club. This blog is a visual diary of our month in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Travelers, foodies, expats and anyone with a little munchkin in their lives should find something of interest on this blog.

Five years ago, my partner and I did a two-month backpacking trip through Southeast Asia as our honeymoon. I kept a [blog of our adventures moving to Auckland](http://www.auckward.com) and one of the most popular posts was one of all the delicious Malaysian food we ate in Penang.

Fast forward to today: We have a new opportunity to spend more time in Malaysia. This time, there will be a little human joining us who is starting to try more and more grownup foods. In this main pic, the baby is trying some char siu on rice from the local Auckland food hall.

I hope to document the most delicious things any one of us may be eating, be it a little pair of hands trying dragon fruit or a big pair of hands tucking into some nasi goreng.

## Why KLean Plate Club?

KL is shorthand for Kuala Lumpur. KLean Plate Club is a cute little name I thought of that can describe our clan and sounded cute for a blog. That's basically it. And the domain KLeanplateclub.com wasn't taken.

## How and why this blog was built

A big reason for starting this blog is so that I would have a project to learn new web dev skills while I'm on maternity leave from my job at a web dev agency. Lifestyle influencers, you may want to stop reading now. Web devs, keep reading...

I built this blog because I wanted to brush up on my React skills. After I built my static personal site, I googled "Can you use React for static sites?", thinking using React for a single-page site would be overkill. (It probably is overkill.)  I went down a Gatsby Google rabbit hole, did the Gatsby tutorials, downloaded the Gatsby blog template and here we are. Hopefully by maintaining this blog, I'll have some background PWA knowledge for when I return to work and perhaps work on some Magento PWA stuff.

## Who is behind KLean Plate Club?

My name is [Tina](https://www.tinatrenkner.com). I'm trained as a journalist and had been working as a hybrid account manager/web developer at an ecommerce agency in Auckland. I like CSS and coffee sometimes, noodles all the time, and being hangry none of the time.
