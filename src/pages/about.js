// ## Why KLean Plate Club?
//
// Five years ago, my partner and I did a two-month backpacking trip through Southeast Asia as our honeymoon. I kept a [blog of our adventures moving to Auckland](http://www.auckward.com) and one of the most popular posts was one of all the delicious Malaysian food we ate in Penang.
//
// Fast forward to today: We have a new opportunity to spend more time in Malaysia.

// KL is shorthand for Kuala Lumpur. KLean Plate Club is a cute little name I thought of that can describe our clan and sounded cute for a blog. That's basically it. And the domain KLeanplateclub.com wasn't taken.
//
// ## How and why this blog was built
//
// A big reason for starting this blog is so that I would have a project to learn new web dev skills while I'm on maternity leave from my job at a web dev agency. Lifestyle influencers, you may want to stop reading now. Web devs, keep reading...
//
// I built this blog because I wanted to brush up on my React skills. After I built my static personal site, I googled "Can you use React for static sites?", thinking using React for a single-page site would be overkill. (It probably is overkill.)  I went down a Gatsby Google rabbit hole, did the Gatsby tutorials, downloaded the Gatsby blog template and here we are. Hopefully by maintaining this blog, I'll have some background PWA knowledge for when I return to work and perhaps work on some Magento PWA stuff.

// ## Who is behind KLean Plate Club?
//
// My name is [Tina](https://www.tinatrenkner.com). I'm trained as a journalist and had been working as a hybrid account manager/web developer at an ecommerce agency in Auckland. I like CSS and coffee sometimes, noodles all the time, and being hangry none of the time.
